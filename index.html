    <p class="intro">Hello everyone! This is Adrian Camacho greeting you from my basement via a little thing we like to call the internet. In this project I'd like to tell you a bit about myself and <span class="highlight">highlight</span> some of the work I've done at epicodus so far. I hope you Enjoy!</p>

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p class="about-me">So we'll start off by getting to know me a little better. I'm 29 years old currently living in SE Portland. I was born in Los Angeles and moved up to McMinnville, Oregon at a young age. I'm first generation Mexican-American and <strong>very proud of that fact!</strong> My parents sacrificed a lot to get to this Country and I'm extremely grateful for all that they've done for me and my sister. Yes! I have a sister, an older one in fact and she lives in SE Portland as well! I've been living up here for the past 6 years with my wonderful partner Abby, our dog Luna and Luna's newest baby brother, our puppy Moo! Well there you go guys there's a little bit about myself but don't worry, if you're dying to hear more guess what? There's more!</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="background">For the past 7 years I've been the service industry. Specifically, bartending at a popular Oregon and Washington restaurant chain; <span class="mc">McMenamins.</span> Education wise, I've receieved my High School Diploma and I've taken a handful of college courses at Portland Community College. Bartending is great and all but, like many others, the pandemic has forced me to spend a lot of time thinking about the future and switching career paths. Programming is something I was always interested in and I'm thankful that <em>Epicodus</em> has given me the opportunity to get into this field!</p>
